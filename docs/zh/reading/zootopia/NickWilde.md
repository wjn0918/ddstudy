Nick Wilde is small-time, con-artist fox, He's charming and clever and always quick with a joke. He's an unrepentant realist and believes you are what you are, no matter how hard you try to overcome your label. To him, all solths are slow, all weasels are weaselly, and all bunnies are dumb,
But when an idealistic rabbit cop named Juddy Hopps outsmarts him, he finds himself actually helping her solve a mystery.
