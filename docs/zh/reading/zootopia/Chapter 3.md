Fifteen year later, Judy Hopps worked her tail off in the Zootopia Police Academy. She was small compared to the rest of cadets-who were elephants, rhinos, and bison- but she was strong-willed.
Because of her size, the physical training was the toughest part.Cadets had to get through obstacles in simulators that mimicked all of the twelve unique ecosystems that made up the city of Zootopia. From freezing Tundratown to sweltering Sahara Square, each ecosystem presented its own set of challenges-whether it was trying to scale an ice wall or survive in a scorching sandstorm.
